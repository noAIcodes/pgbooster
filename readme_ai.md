```

### User Progress
```javascript
{
  currentDay: 1,
  completedTasks: [], // Stores IDs of completed pre-defined tasks
  backlogTasks: [],   // Stores IDs of overdue pre-defined tasks
  revisionTasks: [],  // Stores revision data for pre-defined topics
  improviseList: [],  // Stores improvise topic objects
  customDailyTasks: { // Stores user-added tasks for each day
    // "day1": [{id: "custom_123", text: "My custom task for Day 1", completed: false}],
    // "day2": [{id: "custom_456", text: "Another custom task for Day 2", completed: true}]
  },
  darkMode: false,
  lastActive: timestamp
}
```

## Deployment Guide
1. Clone/download the project files
2. Open index.html in a modern web browser
3. No server setup required (client-side only)
4. For production: Deploy to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Core feature implementation significantly underway. Most features in Phases 1-4 are implemented, reviewed, or refined.
- **Progress**: Estimated 70-75% of planned core features are in place or have substantial groundwork laid.
- **Next Steps**:
    1. **Populate Study Plan**: Complete the 30-day study plan data in [`scripts/studyPlan.js`](scripts/studyPlan.js). **(DONE)**
    2. Thoroughly test all existing functionality with the now complete study plan. This includes:
        - Daily task loading and completion.
        - Progress tracking (daily and overall).
        - Backlog functionality.
        - Spaced repetition scheduling and display.
        - Improvise list functionality.
        - Theme toggling.
    3. Identify and fix any bugs found during testing.
    4. Refine and complete partially implemented or potentially problematic features (e.g., ensure robust backlog task completion flow, verify spaced repetition logic over the full 30-day cycle and beyond).
    5. Address remaining items in Phase 5 (Mobile optimization, Performance tuning, UX enhancements, Cross-browser compatibility checks).
    6. Continuously update this `readme_ai.md` with new findings or changes to the plan.

## Current Task Plan (Session: 2025-05-31 07:00)

**Objective**: Mobile Optimization - Thorough Testing and Refinement.

**Context**: Phase 5 of the "Core Features Implementation Plan" includes "Mobile optimization (basic structure in place, needs thorough testing and refinement)". This task aims to ensure the application is fully responsive and user-friendly on various mobile devices.

**Tasks for this session**:

1.  `[✅]` **Systematic Testing on Mobile Viewports**:
    *   Use browser developer tools to simulate various mobile screen sizes (e.g., iPhone SE, iPhone X/XR/12 Pro, Galaxy S5/S20 Ultra, Pixel 5, iPad Mini/Air).
    *   Test in both portrait and landscape orientations.
2.  `[✅]` **Identify and Document UI/UX Issues**:
    *   Look for layout overflows, broken grids, or elements that are too large/small.
    *   Check for unreadable text (font size, contrast on mobile).
    *   Verify usability of all interactive elements (buttons, checkboxes, input fields, modals, navigation tabs) on touch interfaces.
    *   Ensure modals (Add Custom Task, Improvise List details) are correctly sized and scrollable if content exceeds viewport.
    *   **Key Finding (from user testing):**
        *   **Critical Issue (Resolved)**: Checkbox size scaling problems - current 20x20px checkboxes were too small. Fix: Increased size to 24x24px in `styles/main.css`. User confirmed improvement.
        *   **Impact**: Poor touch usability on mobile devices, difficult to tap checklist items accurately.
3.  `[✅]` **CSS and HTML Adjustments**:
    *   **Done (Checkboxes)**: Increased visual size of `.checklist-checkbox` in `styles/main.css` from 20px to 24px and adjusted font-size for the checkmark icon to improve mobile tap targets. User confirmed fix.
    *   **Done (Task Card Spacing)**: Increased `margin-bottom` for `.task-card` in `styles/components.css` from `var(--spacing-lg)` to `var(--spacing-xl)` to improve vertical spacing in Backlog, Revision, and Improvise tabs.
    *   Implement further necessary CSS media query adjustments in `styles/main.css` and `styles/components.css` based on continued testing.
    *   Make minor HTML structural changes if required for better mobile layout, without altering core functionality.
    *   **New Finding (from user testing - Navigation/Consistency):** Content sections within tab views (e.g., Daily Targets, Backlog) felt "clumped together". Fix: Increased `margin-bottom` for `.task-card`. User confirmed improvement.
4.  `[✅]` **Navigation Testing**:
    *   Thoroughly test the main navigation tabs and any sidebar/menu functionality on mobile. (User feedback indicates general UI is fine).
    *   Ensure the "Go to Day" input and navigation works as expected. (User feedback indicates general UI is fine).
5.  `[✅]` **Cross-Component Consistency**:
    *   Verify that styling, spacing, and branding are consistent across all components and views on mobile. (User feedback indicates general UI is fine).
    *   Check the appearance of task cards (daily, backlog, revision, improvise) on smaller screens. (User feedback indicates general UI is fine).
6.  `[✅]` **Update `readme_ai.md`**:
    *   Documented findings, fixes, and user confirmations during this mobile optimization session.
    *   The "Mobile optimization" feature in Phase 5 will be updated to `[x]`.

## Current Task Plan (Session: 2025-05-31 06:51) - Completed

**Objective**: Review and Refine Spaced Repetition System.

**Context**: The "Core Features Implementation Plan" indicates that the "Spaced repetition system (7-day revision cycle)" is partially implemented (`[~]`) and `SpacedRepetition.js` needs review. Integration points in `taskManager.js` also exist.

**Tasks for this session**:

1.  `[x]` **Review `scripts/SpacedRepetition.js`**:
    *   Understand the current implementation of the 7-day revision cycle.
    *   Identify any logic gaps, potential bugs, or areas for improvement.
    *   Check how revision tasks are scheduled, stored, and retrieved.
    *   Verify the logic for determining when a revision is due.
2.  `[x]` **Review Integration in `scripts/taskManager.js`**:
    *   Examine how `TaskManager.js` calls `SpacedRepetition.js` (e.g., `SpacedRepetition.scheduleRevision(dayPlan)` in `updateTopicCompletionStatus`, `SpacedRepetition.markRevised(task.id)` in `createTaskCard`).
    *   Ensure data flow between modules is correct.
3.  `[x]` **Review UI for Revision Reminders and Highlights**:
    *   The plan mentions "badge updates exist, UI for specific reminders needs review".
    *   Check how revision tasks are displayed in the "Revision" tab.
    *   Assess if the UI clearly indicates due revisions.
4.  `[x]` **Identify and Document Necessary Refinements/Fixes**:
    *   Based on the review, list specific changes needed to complete or improve the spaced repetition system and its UI representation.
5.  `[x]` **Implement Refinements (if straightforward and time permits in this session)**.

**Summary of Refinements Implemented (2025-05-31 06:56):**
*   **Encapsulation of Revision Removal**: Added `SpacedRepetition.removeRevision(topicId)` function to `scripts/SpacedRepetition.js` to handle data updates and UI re-rendering for removed revision tasks. Modified `scripts/taskManager.js` to call this new function, improving modularity.
*   **Revision Card Detail Redundancy**: Simplified the detail string on revision task cards in `scripts/taskManager.js` to avoid repeating the topic name, making the UI cleaner. The detail now primarily shows the subject, as the topic name is in the card title.

---
*Session (2025-05-31 06:56): Completed review and refinement of Spaced Repetition System.*
The Spaced Repetition System was reviewed, including `SpacedRepetition.js`, its integration with `TaskManager.js`, and UI aspects.
Two refinements were implemented:
1. Encapsulated revision removal logic within `SpacedRepetition.js`.
2. Reduced UI redundancy on revision task cards in `TaskManager.js`.
The "Spaced repetition system" and "Revision reminders and highlights" are now marked as `[x]` in the Core Features plan.
---
*Previous Session (2025-05-31 06:49): Implemented User-Defined Daily Tasks feature.*
The "User-Defined Daily Tasks" feature was completed, including updates to data structures, UI, core logic, and UI interactions.
Key files involved: `scripts/storage.js`, `scripts/taskManager.js`, `index.html`, `scripts/app.js`.
The feature allows users to add, complete, and manage custom tasks for their daily schedule.
Testing of this feature is pending by the user.
